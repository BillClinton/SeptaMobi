- 1127 N 4th St (3rd Ward address) autocompletes but fails geocode

Suggestion: Bold the transportation vehicles number in Schedule

extras
	- perks not sortable
	- when loading perks/tokens, whole area should be masked not just list, clicking map before it loads causes issues
	- When selecting a perk, only nearby perks are geocoded, need to geo code address via google api 

Trip planner carousel:
	- Map center does not follow selected leg of trip
	- Some directions are too tall for carousel


Stops Schedule:
	-After selecting a specific route and then press back the item is still selected and unclickable

Nice to have features:
	- Show rail/subway stops on the map
	- Calculate next train, bus, subway car based upon historical data (server side)
	- Show route details (stops list + map) instead of route map from nearby stops
	- Visually show alerts (detours) on route details screen
	- update to sencha 2.3

Planned refactor:
	- Merge schedule and stop controller
