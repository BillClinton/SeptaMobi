Suggestion: Bold the transportation vehicles number in Schedule

extras
	- perks not sortable
	- when loading perks/tokens, whole area should be masked not just list, clicking map before it loads causes issues

Trip planner carousel:
	- Map center does not follow selected leg of trip
	- It would be nice if carousel size was dynamic, seems a bit large now

Stops Schedule:
	-After selecting a specific route and then press back the item is still selected and unclickable

Schedule:
	- Directions are still not being determined properly for all routes, see bus #1 for parx casino

Nice to have features:
	- Show rail/subway stops on the map
	- Calculate next train, bus, subway car based upon historical data (server side)
	- Show route details (stops list + map) instead of route map from nearby stops
	- Visually show alerts (detours) on route details screen
	- update to sencha 2.3

Planned refactor:
	- Merge schedule and stop controller
