- 1127 N 4th St (3rd Ward address) autocompletes but fails geocode

Suggestion: Bold the transportation vehicles number in Schedule

Trip PLanner:
Reenable clear icon , needs css

extras
	- perks not sortable
	- selecting a perk should show it on the map
	- when loading perks/tokens, whole area should be masked not just list, clicking map before it loads causes issues

Assets are missing for perks, token locations, and other bus direction

Trip planner carousel:
	- Map center does not follow selected leg of trip
	- Some directions are too tall for carousel

Nice to have features:
	- Show rail/subway stops on the map
	- Calculate next train, bus, subway car based upon historical data (server side)
	- Show route details (stops list + map) instead of route map from nearby stops
	- Visually show alerts (detours) on route details screen
	- better geocoder
	- update to sencha 2.3

Planned refactor:
	- Merge schedule and stop controller
